## Example
In a quiet old alley in Beijing, there lived a ginger cat named "Hulu" (Gourd). He wasn't a stray, but rather the "king" of this alley. Every morning, he would patrol his territory, from the gray-tiled roofs to the roots of the old pagoda tree. All the residents in the alley knew him; Auntie Zhang would leave him a small dried fish, and Grandpa Li would leave the door ajar for him to slip inside for a nap.

One rainy day, a young musician with a violin moved into the alley. Melodious and sometimes melancholic music flowed from his window. Hulu would often crouch quietly beneath the window, listening intently as if he could understand the stories within the music. As days went by, the sound of the violin became the new background music of the alley. Hulu was no longer just patrolling a silent kingdom; his territory now had its own exclusive soundtrack, belonging to him and to the young musician.
